# **Hello, I'm Zhenya**

I like to play video games and watch anime. And also I have a lovely cat named Brules.

Lately, I've been trying to improve my web-dev skills, cause I like to study and explore new stuff. But I'm probably not going to work in some boring company, at least if they don't have free food. I ❤️ pizza. The main reason that has motivated me so far is the opportunity to bring my ideas to life.
